# facial-keypoint-detection

This is a CNN based facial keypoint detector using Keras open source library on tensorflow backend, which could identify 15 locations on the human face.
The output will be (x,y) coordinates of the keypoints detected in the given input image.

If you run the model file, this will save the trained model as my_model.h5.
